* Title: Deploying a Rails application to a Linux server located in a virtual machine
* Installing VirtualBox
  1. Install the Sun version of VirtualBox (not the OpenSource
     version, it has some minor drawbacks)
  2. For now we will mostly use the default settings except for
     Memory: If our machine allows it, give it 2GB. Also, deactivate
     audio support (not needed on a server)
* Installing Ubuntu Server 9.10 on VirtualBox (basic system)
  1. Get the iso image of the Ubuntu server version from the Ubuntu
     homepage.
  2. Mount the iso image for installation
  3. Update all packages: 
     : ubuntu-server$ sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
* Setting up Ubuntu Server 9.10 on VirtualBox
** Apache2
   1. Install apache2:
      : ubuntu-server$ sudo aptitude install apache2
** Add user to group www-data
   1. Check that group www-data exists:
      : ubuntu-server$ grep -e ^www /etc/group
   2. Add user to group www-data:
      : ubuntu-server$ sudo adduser patrick www-data
      
** SSH
   1. Install openSSH:
      : ubuntu-server$ sudo aptitude install openssh-server
** Version control system (SVN, Git, Mercurial)
   Pick the version control system of your choice:
   * Mercurial
     : ubuntu-server$ sudo aptitude install mercurial
   * Git
     : ubuntu-server$ sudo aptitude install \
     : git-doc git-arch git-cvs git-svn git-email git-daemon-run gitweb 
   * Subversion
     : ubuntu-server$ sudo aptitude install subversion
** Ruby and Rails
   * Ruby
     : ubuntu-server$ sudo aptitude install rubygems ruby1.8-dev build-essential \
     : libopenssl-ruby ruby libsqlite3-dev apache2-prefork-dev \
     : libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev
   * Rails
     : ubuntu-server$ sudo gem install rails rake
   * SQLite3 support
     : ubuntu-server$ sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby
** Passenger
   : ubuntu-server$ sudo gem install passenger
   : ubuntu-server$ sudo /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/passenger-install-apache2-module
** Mongrel (not sure if this is needed; I don't think so)
   : sudo gem install mongrel
** Restarting Apache2
   : ubuntu-server$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
** Configure Apache2
*** Simple test version
    * This setup assumes we copied our Rails application to /var/www/demo.
    * Add the following to /etc/apache2/apache2.conf:
      : LoadModule passenger_module /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.2.11/et/apache2/mod_passenger.so
      : PassengerRoot /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.2.11
      : PassengerRuby /usr/bin/ruby1.8
      : 
      : NameVirtualHost 192.168.178.21
      : 
      : <VirtualHost 192.168.178.21>
      : DocumentRoot /var/www/demo/public/
      : 
      :   <Directory /var/www/demo/public>
      :     Order allow,deny
      :     Allow from all
      :   </Directory>
      : 
      : </VirtualHost>

    * This does not work yet. Questions:
      - Where to put Rails application?
      - How to setup Apache?
      - Any further config changes needed on host?
*** Configure Apache2 the Debian/Ubuntu way
    1. We want our default site to be located at /var/www/demo.
    2. IMPORTANT Required for every new site:
       : ubuntu-server$ sudo cp \
       : /etc/apache2/sites-available/default \
       : /etc/apache2/sites-available/demo.conf
    3. Edit the new demo.conf file
    4. Change DocumentRoot to point to the new location
    5. Change Directory directive to point to the new location
    6. Now, we must deactivate the old site, and activate our new
       one. Ubuntu/Debian provides two small utilities that take care
       of this: a2ensite (apache2enable site) and a2dissite
       (apache2disable site).
    7. IMPORTANT Required for every new site:
       : ubuntu-server$ sudo a2dissite default && sudo a2ensite demo
    8. Restart Apache:
       : ubuntu-server$ sudo apache2ctl restart
    9. In the client: Map 192.168.178.21 (the server ip) to
       "ubuntu-server" (more precisely: the output of uname -n) by
       adding the following line to /etc/hosts:
       : 192.168.178.21  ubuntu-server
    10. Now call the URL http://ubuntu-server/demo from your client
       	browser.
* Networking with VirtualBox
  * All previous changes were made within a virtual machine (Ubuntu
    Server edition 9.10). I'll refer to this as the "guest" in this
    section.
  * For installation I used the default NAT connection. Doing so gave
    me safe access to the internet.
  * After installation I created a snapshot.
  * Then I switched the network configuration of this virtual client
    from NAT to Bridged. This changed the guest (Ubuntu-Server) IP
    address from 10.x.x.x to a real address in my local network
    (192.168.x.x).[fn:1]
  * After restarting the client, get the IP address from within the
    client (f.ex. using ifconfig). Use this IP address and try to ping
    it from your host. It should work. If it does, try to log in via
    SSH from your host. It should work.
  * We have at least 2 choices of getting our Rails app to the server
    (our virtual client): via SSH or via a shared folder between our
    virtual host system and our virtual client system (the
    server). Using a shared folder is a bit simpler, but requires the
    installation of the VirtualBox Guest Additions (see below). We
    will use one of these simple approaches before we go on to more
    sophisticated (automated) deployment routines using Capistrano
    later on.
  * If all went well we are now ready to try our first Rails
    deployment.
** Installing VirtualBox Guest Additions on Virtual client == Ubuntu-Server
   * Plugin guest additions from the VirtualBox menu while the
     Ubuntu-Server is running as Virtual client.
   * Manually mount the cdrom drive: sudo mount /dev/cdrom
   * sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run
   * Installation OK, but we can still not resize the window. :-( We
     don't have an X-Server, so this is expected.
   * We can use byobu after sshing into the guest system (our
     server). TTY-Multiplexing is great.
*** Update for Ubuntu Server 10.04
    The following steps are required for installing VirtualBox
    GuestAdditions on Ubuntu Server 10.04:
    1. $ sudo aptitude install dkms build-essential
    2. Reboot: $ sudo init 6
    3. Devices -> Install GuestAdditions
    4. $ sudo mkdir /media/cdrom
    5. $ sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
    6. $ sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run
    7. ignore warning "Could not find the X.Org or XFree86 Window
       System": we're on a server without X, so this is OK.
* SSH connection between Virtualbox Host and Guest (2-way)
  1. Check if public key is present on host:
     host$ test -e ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub || ssh-keygen -t dsa
  2. Allow host-to-host connection by appending public key to known hosts:
     host$ cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
  3. Copy public key from host to guest
     host$ scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub patrick@testserver/home/patrick/.ssh/pub_key_from_host
  4. Append host public key to known hosts in guest system and clean up:
     guest$ cat ~/.ssh/pub_key_from_host >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
     guest$ rm ~/.ssh/pub_key_from_host
  5. Now we have to create a public key on the guest system:
     guest$ test -e ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub || ssh-keygen -t dsa
  6. ...copy it to the host...
     guest$ scp id_dsa.pub patrick@192.168.178.20:/home/patrick/.ssh/key_from_test_server
  7. ...and append it to the host's known keys:
     host$ cat ~/.ssh/key_from_test_server >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
** Convenience: Update /etc/hosts
   Instead of using the IP address for guest and host we can modify
   the the file /etc/hosts on the guest and host machine. Note to
   self: The name must match the actual machine name defined in
   /etc/hostname!
* Optional: Install RSpec (another test framework for Rails applications)
  : sudo gem install rspec
  : sudo gem install rspec-rails
** Integration with windows manager
   : sudo gem install autotest-rails 
* Creating a minimalistic Rails application on our development system (=host system)
  Since this is a tutorial about Rails deployment on a virtual
  machine, I'll assume you know how to create a Rails
  application. Therefore I'll just provide short comments and the
  commands to create a very simple Rails app so we can go along and
  deploy it to our server.

** Create project demo
   View script [[file:create_minimal_rails_project.sh::bin%20bash][create-minimal-rails.sh]], adapt to your needs, and run the script.


* Footnotes

[fn:1] Sidenote: Ensure that the guest system has a unique hostname
within your network. You can change the hostname of your guest system
by editing the file /etc/hostname.
